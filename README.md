# symmetrical-octo-system

A collection of tools, experiments. and applications related to my attempts to finally resolve the fact that 
there's no bible software that lets me take sermon notes in the manner of which I want to be able to.

We'll start by scraping bible.com NKJV, and building a simple note-taking and bible-reading app, and see 
where it goes from there. Along the way we'll play with parser combinators and web scrapers and RegExs.
It's going to be fun.
